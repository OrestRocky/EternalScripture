Preserving the Sacred. Forever.

Description (EN):
EternalScripture is a Web3-based preservation project dedicated to the eternal safeguarding of rare Biblical documents, collectible cards, and spiritual artifacts.
By storing their digital copies on IPFS and registering immutable proofs on the blockchain, we ensure that sacred texts, images, and interpretations will never be lost, deleted, or altered â€” no matter what happens in the physical world.

This project merges faith, technology, and historical memory into a decentralized archive that transcends borders, regimes, and time.

Key Features:

IPFS-powered permanent file storage
Blockchain-anchored authenticity and traceability
NFT-ready metadata format for future extensions
GitHub-hosted open source repository
Potential for global collaboration and digital evangelism
