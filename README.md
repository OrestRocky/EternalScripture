EternalScripture

Preserving the Sacred. Forever.

Description

EternalScripture is a Web3-based preservation project dedicated to the eternal safeguarding of rare Biblical documents, collectible cards, and spiritual artifacts. By storing their digital copies on IPFS and registering immutable proofs on the blockchain, we ensure that sacred texts, images, and interpretations will never be lost, deleted, or altered â€” no matter what happens in the physical world.

This project merges faith, technology, and historical memory into a decentralized archive that transcends borders, regimes, and time.

Features

âœ… Permanent file storage via IPFS

âœ… Blockchain-anchored content verification

âœ… NFT-ready metadata structure

âœ… Open source repository for public transparency

âœ… Designed for cross-border collaboration and long-term spiritual preservation
