**Preserving the Sacred. Forever.**

## Description
EternalScripture is a Web3-based preservation project dedicated to the eternal safeguarding of rare Biblical documents, collectible cards, and spiritual artifacts. By storing their digital copies on IPFS and registering immutable proofs on the blockchain, we ensure that sacred texts, images, and interpretations will never be lost, deleted, or altered â€” no matter what happens in the physical world.

This project merges faith, technology, and historical memory into a decentralized archive that transcends borders, regimes, and time.

- âœ… Permanent file storage via IPFS
- âœ… Blockchain-anchored content verification
- âœ… NFT-ready metadata structure
- âœ… Open source repository for public transparency
- âœ… Designed for cross-border collaboration and long-term spiritual preservation

## Upload Script (`scripts/upload_to_ipfs.py`)
```python
import os
import json
import requests

API_TOKEN = "your_web3_storage_token"
API_URL = "https://api.web3.storage/upload"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"}

files = [f for f in os.listdir("../cards") if f.endswith(".jpg") or f.endswith(".png")]

for file_name in files:
    with open(f"../cards/{file_name}", "rb") as f:
        response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=HEADERS, files={"file": f})
        if response.ok:
            cid = response.json()["cid"]
            print(f"Uploaded {file_name} -> CID: {cid}")
        else:
